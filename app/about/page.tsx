                                    Grace Community Church was founded in 1985 by a small group of families who shared a vision for a
                                    church that would be welcoming to all and deeply rooted in scripture.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What began as a small gathering in a living room has grown into a vibrant community of believers
                                    dedicated to serving God and our neighbors. Through the years, we've been blessed to see countless
                                    lives transformed by God's grace.

                                    In 2005, we moved to our current location, which has allowed us to expand our ministries and better
                                    serve the community. Throughout our growth, we've remained committed to our founding principles of
                                    authentic worship, biblical teaching, and compassionate outreach.
